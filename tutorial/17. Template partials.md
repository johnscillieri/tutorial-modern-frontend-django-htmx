# Template partials 

In our application we have one page (represented by index.html) and one partial template. 

This is a very simple application. 

Imagine how weird things will get if we had 5 pages, and each page had 5 partials associated with it. 

- your templates directory would be very noisy, it would be hard to know what partial is associated with what page unless you organised your stuff very carefully 
- you would need to be aware of the organising strategy every time you created a new view function 

If you are working on a project by yourself then this might be fine, but one of the arguments against HTMX is that this kind of complexity doesn't scale well. 
There is a danger that all these template files could turn into spaghetti, if you aren't careful.

## Django template partials saves the day

Take a look at this: https://github.com/carltongibson/django-template-partials 

## Let's put your partial template inside your index.html file 

First of all, follow the instructions inside the repo above and get the django-template-partials package installed.

Now, go to your index.html file and add the following:

```
{% load partials %}

{% partialdef todo-item %}

 <!-- copy-paste the contents of partial_todo_item.html here -->

{% endpartialdef todo-item %}
```

Now delete `partial_todo_item.html`.

Your code is now broken :) It expects there to be a template called `partial_todo_item.html`, but we moved that code.

## Get the code to work again

You'll now need to go find all the parts of your code that reference `partial_todo_item.html` and update them to use the partial instead. 

The docs on the `django-template-partials` do a good job of explaining how to do that. 

When you think you are done, run your tests and make sure everything passes.

## Clear structures

Now if you have 5 pages and they each have 5 partials associated with them, those partials will be inside the correct files. They will be in predictable places and you'll know exactly what they are for and where they are used.

If a partial is used in multiple pages then it is useful to put it in a separate file, for example `_common_partials.html`.
