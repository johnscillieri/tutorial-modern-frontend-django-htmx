# C is for Create 

Our goal is to:

1. Add a form to the index page. It should look good
2. When the user submits the form then we need to create an item in the database
3. We then need to update the gui so that it shows the item we just created. It should no longer say "Nothing to see". We would like to do this without refreshing the page

To get this right, we'll need to cover a few different things:

1. The Django ORM: This plugs into the database
2. Django Forms: Once we have the database table defined, we can create a form that plugs into it quite neatly 
3. HTMX: We'll use this to update what we see on the page without needing to refresh

## The Django ORM 

Go to `todos/models.py` file. It's pretty empty for now. 

You'll need to create a model for the thing you are trying to store. Since I'm making a todo list application, mine looks like this:

```
from django.db import models


class TodoItem(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)

```

Models are covered (slightly) in part 2 of the official Django tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial02/

You can also learn more here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/models/

For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll just make one model. Nothing too fancy.

## Make a form 

Inside your todos app, make a new file called `forms.py`. Here you will define a form for creating a new `TodoItem` instance. 

My `forms.py` file looks like this:

```
from . import models
from django.forms import ModelForm


class CreateTodoForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = models.TodoItem
        fields = ["title"]
```

This is intentionally a very simple form. Our model has a title and a description, but we have decided to make a form that only asks for a title. 

Now go to your `views.py` file, import your form, and pass it into the render function like so:

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methods
from . import forms   # IMPORT IT


@require_http_methods(["GET"])
def index(request):

    form = forms.CreateTodoForm() # instantiate the form
    context = {"form": form}      # create a context
    return render(request, "todos/index.html", context) # pass the context to the render function
```

Now we need to get the form to show up on our web page.  To do that we need to update `index.html`.

Mine now looks like this:

(Pay special attention to the `<form>` tag and what is inside it.)

```
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Things to do</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl sm:px-6 lg:px-8 space-y-4 pt-4">

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-900 sm:truncate sm:text-3xl sm:tracking-tight">Things to do
        </h1>


        <div class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-transparent/30 pt-6">
            Nothing to see here...
        </div>


        <div class="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-2 flex justify-center">
            <div>

                <h2
                    class="text-xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-800 sm:truncate sm:text-2xl sm:tracking-tight text-center">
                    Add Item</h2>

                <form>
                    {% csrf_token %}
                    {{ form }}
                    <input type="submit" value="Add"
                        class="rounded bg-green-600 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-green-500 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-green-600">
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

Now, when you refresh the page, you'll see a form at the bottom of the page:

Right now the form doesn't do anything! 

## Learn more

You'll notice that there is a new div at the bottom that contains the form. And we are doing some weird things like this:

```
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form }}
```

Those curly braces and percentage signs are a part of Django's template language. You can learn more here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/templates/

The `{% csrf_token %}` line makes sure that a special token is sent to the server when the form is submitted. CSRF Tokens are used to prevent cross site request forgery. You can learn more here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/csrf/ 

If you open up your browser dev-tools (F12 on chrome) then you should be able to see that there is a hidden form field called `csrfmiddlewaretoken`.

## Understanding all the different files 

If you are new to Django then all the different python modules might be getting confusing. We have `views.py`, `urls.py`, `models.py`, `forms.py` and then there aer also a bunch of template html files... It's a lot!

A picture is worth a thousand words. A picture with a thousand words on it is even better.

## Side quest: Bigger form

The form on your page have one field and one button. It's pretty simple. 

Can you add another field? What about the todo list item description?

## Crispy side quest 

As you build more complicated forms you'll realise that they are kinda ugly...  

There is a simple solution. 

- install Crispy tailwind: https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-tailwind 
- use the `|crispy` template filter on your forms. 

This is explained in the crispy tailwind docs. 

As long as your website is in light mode then this will yield good results always. So it's worth doing!
